Cousera: Course from Getting and Cleaning Data
1. The file was downloaded and decompressed in the path:
C:/Users/user/Data_Science/r_prog/miscellaneous_files/getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset/
2. We load the dplyr library
3. We load the different txt files to the dataframes
4. We add data frames by rows and columns
5. We extract the mean and std of the measurements
6. We use activity names to name the activities in the dataset
7. Label the data set with descriptive variable names.
8. From the previous dataframe we create a second ordered and independent "training" dataset with the average of each variable for each column.
9. In the entreamiento.txt file it contains the final ordered data.
